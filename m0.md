#### Microsoft Security Compliance and Identity Fundamentals | M0 Notes

# M1-1 Security and Compliance Concepts

Shared responsibilities model 
- Responsibilities always retained by the customer organization include: 
  - Information and data 
  - Devices (mobile and PCs) 
  - Accounts and identities 
 
Defense in depth 
- Physical Security 
- Identity and Access 
- Perimeter 
- Network 
- Compute 
- Application 
- Data 
 
CIA Triad 
 
Zero Trust (Trust no one, Verify everything) 
- 3 Principal 
  - Verify Explicitly 
  - Least Privilege Access 
  - Assume Breach 
- 6 Foundational Pillars 
  - Identity 
  - Application 
  - Devices 
  - Infrastructure 
  - Network 
  - Data 

Encryption 
- Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption 
- 3 States of Data 
  - Data in Use 
  - Data in Transit 
  - Data at Rest 
- Hashing 
  - Does not need keys and cannot be "decrypt" to original 
 
Compliance 
- Data residency 
  - Govern how data can be stored and how it can be transferred, processed or accessed internationally 
- Data sovereignty 
  - The subjection of data to laws and regulations of country/region on how it's physically collected, held or processed. 
  - Will be complicated due to collection, storage, processing can all be done from different location 
- Data privacy 
  - Fundamental principal laws of privacy are to provide notice and being transparent about collection, processing, use and sharing of personal data 
  - Originally it means any information / PII (personally identifiable information), but now it has expanded to be any data that is directly or indirectly linked back to a person. 

# M1-2 Identity Concepts 

Authentication / AuthN 
- Process of proving that a person is who they say they are 
 
Authorization / AuthZ 
- Determine the level of access or permission an authenticated person has to data and resources 
 
Identity 
- Set of things that define or characterize someone or something  
 
Four Pillars of Identity Infrastructure 
- Administration 
- Authentication 
- Authorization 
- Auditing 
 
Modern Authentication consist of Identity Provider (IDP) 
- IDP provides authentication, authorization and auditing 
- A fundamental capability of modern AuthN and IDP is Single Sign-On (SSO) 
- E.g., of cloud-based identity provider: Microsoft Azure Active Directory 

![img](img/m00-01.png)

Claims 
- Set of information 
 
Subject 
- Unique Identifier to a specific person 
- This is because a person name can change 
 
Audience 
- Which server can view this token 

Directory 
- Hierarchical structure that stores information about objects on the network. 
- Stores directory data and makes it available to network users, administrators, services, and applications. 
 
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).  
- Stores information about members of the domain, including devices and users, verifies their credentials, and defines their access rights.  
- A server running AD DS is a domain controller (DC). 
- AD DS is a central component in organizations with on-premises IT infrastructure.  
- AD DS gives organizations the ability to manage multiple on-premises infrastructure components and systems using a single identity per user.  
- AD DS does not natively support mobile devices, SaaS applications, or line of business apps that require modern authentication methods. 
 
Azure Active Directory 
- Provides organizations with an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution for all their apps across cloud and on-premises.  
 
Federation 
- SSO between multiple IDP 
- Federation may not be a two-way trust street or on cloud

# M2-1 Services and Identity Types of Azure AD 

Microsoft's cloud-based IAM has four types of Azure AD. 

- Free 
  - Allow administration of users and create groups 
  - Synchronize with on-premise Active Directory 
  - Create basic report 
  - Configure self-service password change for cloud users 
  - Enable single sign-on across Azure, Microsoft 365 and many popular SaaS apps 
  - Included in subscriptions to Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, Intune and Power Platform 
- Office 365 Apps 
  - Include all features in Free version. 
  - Include self-service password reset for cloud users

  - Office 365 Apps edition of Azure Active Directory is included in subscriptions to Office 365 E1, E3, E5, F1, and F3. 
- Premium P1 
  - Include all features in free and Office 365 apps 
  - Support advanced administration 
    - Dynamic groups 
     - Self-service group management 
     - Microsoft Identity Manager (an on-premises IAM suite) 
     - Cloud write-back capabilities which allow self-service password reset for on-premise users 
- Premium P2 
  - Offer all P1 features and Azure Active Directory Identity Protection 
     - Provide risk-based conditional access to apps and critical company data 
  - Give Privileged Identity Management 
     - Discover, restrict, and monitor administrators and their access to resources and provide just-in-time access when needed 

Azure AD manages different type of identities 
- User 
  - Able to create group and assign people with the same privilege 
  - With Azure AD B2B collaboration, we are able to add external guest and share resources 
- Service principal 
  - Identity for application. 
  - Require application to be registered with Azure AD to enable integration 
  - Enable core features such as authentication and authorization of the application 
- Managed Identity 
  - Type of service principal that are automatically managed in Azure AD and eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials 
  - Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to Azure resources that support Azure AD authentication and can be used without any extra cost 
  - Two types of Managed Identities 
- System-Assigned 
- Enable managed identity directly on service instance. 
- When enabled, an identity is created in Azure AD that is tied to the lifecycle of that service instance 
- Once resource is deleted, Azure will automatically delete the identity 
- By design, only Azure resource can use this identity to request tokens from Azure AD 
- User-Assigned 
- Allow the creation of a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource that can be assign to one or more instances of an Azure service 
-  The identity is managed separately from the resources that use it 
  - ![img](img/m00-01.png)
  - ![img](img/m00-01.png)
- Device 
  - A piece of hardware such as mobile devices, laptops, servers or printers. 
  - Device identities can be set up differently in Azure AD 
- Azure AD registered devices 
- Allow BYOD as personal devices can access organisational resources without organisational account. 
- Supports Windows 10 and above, iOS, Android and MacOS 
- Azure AD joined devices 
- A company-owned device that needs to sign in with an organisational account. 
- Windows 10 or greater (except Home edition) and Windows Server 2019 Virtual Machines 
- Hybrid Azure AD joined devices 
- Devices that are joined to on-premises Active Directory implementation  and Azure AD which needs to sign in with organisational account 
- Registering and joining devices to Azure AD provide SSO to cloud-based resources 
- E.g., can use tools like Microsoft Intune to do Mobile Device Management and Mobile Application Management. 
 
Azure AD External Identities 
- Admins can set up federation with identity providers so that external users can sign in with existing social or enterprise accounts 
- Features of Premium P1 and Premium P2 Azure AD editions 
- Two different Azure AD external identities 
  - B2B 
- Allow to share apps and resources with external users 
- Can enable self-service sign-up to let external users sign up for apps or resources themselves 
- Allow SSO with other Azure AD-connected apps 
  - B2C 
- Identity Management Solution for consumer and customer facing apps 
- A Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) solution 
- Allow users to sign in with their own social or enterprise account for SSO to Azure apps, enterprise apps or customer owned apps within Azure AD B2C tenant. 
- It handles scaling and safety of authentication platform, monitoring and automatically handling threats like denial-of-service, password spray or brute force attack 
- Managed in the Azure AD B2C directory, separately from organisation's employee and partner directory 
 
Hybrid Identity 
- It is important to think of the right authentication method for Azure AD solution in a hybrid model of cloud and on-premise. 
- Each hybrid authentication method require an on-premises active directory. 
- Azure AD Connect, an on-premise Microsoft application that server as a bridge between Azure AD and on-premise AD is required to be run on the server 
  - Azure AD Password hash synchronization 
- Send on-premise password hash to cloud via AD connect with additional security applied. 
- Synchronisation will occur to ensure hash is always updated and allow on-premise users to authenticate with Azure AD to access cloud-based app when on-premise AD is down 
  - Azure AD Pass-through authentication 
- For organisation who want to enforce their on-premises AD security and password policy by authenticating like Azure AD password hash synchronisation but on on-premise. 
- Has additional requirement of running one or more authentication agents that helps to authenticate user as it serve as an intermediary between Azure AD and the on-premise AD 
- Due to use of authenticating agents, there will be a larger infrastructure footprint 
- This authentication method should apply to distributed, redundant software and hardware to provide high availability of sing-in request as outage of on-premises server will not allow authentication to Microsoft 365 
  - Federated Authentication 
- Recommended for organisation using authentication methods (E.g., sign-on with smart cards or certificates, or on-premises multi-factor authentication or third party solution) or advanced features that are not supported in Azure AD. 
- Hands off the authentication process to a separated trusted authentication system such as on-premises Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to validate user's password. 
- Ensure user authentication occur on-premise 
- Requires additional server to support federation and thus larger infrastructure footprint 
- Can choose to set up password hash synchronisation as a backup in the scenario where AD FS infrastructure fails 

# M2-2 Authentication Capabilities of Azure AD 

Password 
- Phone-based authentication 
  - SMS-based authentication 
  - Voice call verification

- To use SSPR, users must be: 
  - Assigned an Azure AD license 
  - Enabled for SSPR by an administrators 
  - Registered with the authentication methods that they want to use 
- By default administrators cannot use security questions as verification method as compared to normal users 
- When user reset password with SSPR, it can be written back to an on-premise AD. 
  - Password write-back allow users to use updated credentials with on-premise device and application without delay 
  - Reset via mobile app notification, mobile app code and email 
- Admin can configure email notification to be sent when SSPR happens
